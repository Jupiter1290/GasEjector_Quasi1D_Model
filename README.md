## Project Overview

I developed a quasi-one-dimensional MATLAB solver to model compressible flow in gas‚Äìgas ejectors, coding the governing equations entirely from first principles.

Unlike standard Fanno-only formulations, this model explicitly couples **wall friction** and **variable cross-sectional area**, allowing it to capture both **viscous losses** and **area-driven acceleration** effects along the ejector axis.

The solver predicts **Mach number**, **pressure**, and **temperature** variations across each ejector segment (converging nozzle, mixing duct, and diffuser). It provides a compact analytical‚Äìnumerical framework suitable for **parametric studies**, **geometry optimization**, and **pre-CFD design validation**.

This implementation represents the **quasi-1D analytical stage** and will be validated against **3D ANSYS Fluent simulations** in the next phase.
